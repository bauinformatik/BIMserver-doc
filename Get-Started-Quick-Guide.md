### **Stand-alone BIMserver (version 1.2)**

1. Read the [System Requirements](https://github.com/opensourceBIM/BIMserver/wiki/Requirements)
2. Make sure you can execute a JAR file by double-clicking the file. If not, check that Java is installed properly and the environment variables are setup correctly.
3. Read about [which files to download](https://github.com/opensourceBIM/BIMserver/wiki/Download). Download the latest file, e.g. [bimserver-1.2.jar](http://bimserver.org/download/).
4. Read [JAR Starter](https://github.com/opensourceBIM/BIMserver/wiki/JAR-Starter)
Note: After clicking the START button, it takes up to a few minutes for the BIMserver to load and configure various components. Wait until you see something like "INFO  org.bimserver.JarBimServer - Server started successfully" before clicking on "Launch Webbrowser".

5. Read [Setup Guide](https://github.com/opensourceBIM/BIMserver/wiki/Setup)
6. Watch this [Open Source BIMserver](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=greB5jHi6JQ) video.

If the above steps are followed correctly, you should have BIMserver launched successfully on a browser with the URL: http://localhost:8080. If failed, try another port, e.g. instead of 8080, try 8082.

7. If the web page displays the status as "NOT SETUP", go to the admin page at http://localhost:8080/admin
8. Complete the form and create your account as requested using your email address.
9. The current version of BIMserver has no user interface (GUI), but a console page with a list of functionalities can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/console.html
